    "## Plastic Cost Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a proof of concept for predicting plastic costs based on various factors using data analytics. The prediction will focus on understanding the correlation between plastic raw material prices and business trends. The project is being carried out by a team of students pursuing a Master of Science in Big Data for Business, in their second year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's business landscape, accurately predicting the costs associated with plastic materials is crucial for Schneider Electric (SE). However, it can be challenging to foresee how plastic costs will evolve in the future due to various factors influencing the market. To address this issue, leveraging data and AI technologies can provide valuable insights to forecast these costs effectively. By analyzing historical data, market trends, raw material prices, supply and demand dynamics, and economic indicators, we hope that we can develop a predictive model that helps businesses estimate future plastic costs with greater accuracy. This data-driven approach could empower Schneider Electric to make informed decisions, optimize its budgeting, and strategically plan its procurement strategies, ultimately maximizing profitability and minimizing financial risks associated with plastic materials.\n",

    "This exercise will try to tackle this issue by making a model to accurately predict the plastic raw material prices leveraging various data sources and AI.  \n",

    "### Expectations \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Expectations \n",
    "1. For Polyamide 6 (PA6) plastic raw material : we want to predict the price in 3, 6 & 9 months from now with Buying prices cost prediction value, trends and understand what contributed the most to the result (features importance)\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Looking in a second step at SE product selling prices and competitors selling prices histories from website distributors. How could you link Business trends and raw materials trends?\n",
    "Identify telling stories at Business level taking into account your raw material prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "All those precious prediction would be used for Procurement negotiation, and/or Pricing strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science objectives\n",
    "We expect the students to take in consideration the following steps, this list is not exhaustive, other steps can be added. \n",
    "1. **State of the Art :** Research of scientific articles on raw material price / time-series forecasting\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing :** Apply the different data science techniques to sanitize the dataset and make it usable by AI models.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering :** Select the most relevant features, create new one...\n",
    "4. **Model Building :** Apply AI algorithms to train a predictive model and fine-tune the models. Students can use the libraries of their choice as long as they are open source and the licenses are verified. You are more than encouraged to test different models.  \n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation :** Assess the performance of the different models using appropriate evaluation metrics, including CO2 emissions.\n",
    "6. **Explainability :** Explain the results of the models and understand what impacted the most the results. \n",
    "7. **Ethical AI :** Being sure that the data is ethically sourced and that libraries are truly open-source.\n",
